### Prerequisites

A Data Product should already exist in order to attach new components to it. The component **Snowflake Output Port** should exist in the Data Product.


### Component Basic Information

This section includes the basic information that any component of Witboost must have -

- Name: Required name used for display purposes on your Data Product.
- Fully Qualified Name: Output Port fully qualified name, this is optional as will be generated by the system if not given by you.
- Description: A short description to help others understand what this Workload is for.
- Domain: The Domain of the Data Product this Output Port belongs to. Be sure to choose it correctly as is a fundamental part of the Output Port and cannot be changed afterwards.
- Data Product: The Data Product this Output Port belongs to, be sure to choose the right one.
- Identifier: Unique ID for this new entity inside the domain. Don't worry to fill this field, it will be automatically filled for you.
- Development Group: Development group of this Data Product. Don't worry to fill this field, it will be automatically filled for you.
- Depends On: If you want your Output Port to depend on other components from the Data Product, you can choose this option.

  > In order for the Hasura Output Port to consume data from Snowflake, we need to add Snowflake Output Port component in the Depends On field.

*Example:*

| Field name              | Example value                                                                                          |
|:------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Name**                | Hasura Vaccinations Output Port                                                                        |

| ***Identifier***        | Will look something like this: *healthcare.vaccinationsdp.0.snowflake-vaccinations-output-port*        |
| ***Development Group*** | Might look something like this: *group:datameshplatform* Depends on the Data Product development group |
