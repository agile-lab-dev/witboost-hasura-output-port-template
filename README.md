This repository is part of our [Starter Kit](https://github.com/agile-lab-dev/witboost-starter-kit) meant to showcase Witboost's integration capabilities and provide a "batteries-included" product.

# Hasura Output Port Template

- [Overview](#overview)
- [Usage](#usage)

## Overview

![Hasura Output Port](docs/images/template_introduction_diagram.png)

Use this template to create an Output Port based on a Hasura Enterprise instance. It enables consumers to access your Data Product's data using GraphQL queries. The underlying data is provided by another Output Port; right now only Snowflake Output Ports are supported.

Refer to the [Witboost Starter Kit repository](https://github.com/agile-lab-dev/witboost-starter-kit) for information on the Specific Provisioner that can be used to deploy components created with this template.

### What's a Template?

A Template is a tool that helps create components inside a Data Mesh. Templates help establish a standard across the organization. This standard leads to easier understanding, management and maintenance of components. Templates provide a predefined structure so that developers don't have to start from scratch each time, which leads to faster development and allows them to focus on other aspects, such as testing and business logic.

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.witboost.agilelab.it/docs/p1_user/p6_advanced/p6_1_templates/#getting-started).

### What's an Output Port?

An Output Port refers to the interface that a Data Product uses to provide data to other components or systems within the organization. The methods of data sharing can range from APIs to file exports and database links.

## Hasura

[Hasura](https://hasura.io/) is an open-source platform that provides a unified API layer over your data sources. It can be used to expose data from a variety of sources, including relational databases, NoSQL databases, and cloud storage.
It provides a number of benefits, including:
- Ease of use: Hasura is easy to use, even for non-technical users. It can be deployed in minutes, and it does not require any code changes to your data sources.
- Flexibility: Hasura can be used to expose data from a variety of sources. It also supports a variety of data access patterns, such as CRUD, GraphQL, and SQL.
- Security: Hasura provides a number of security features, such as role-based access control (RBAC) and data encryption.
- Scalability: Hasura can be scaled easily to meet the needs of your applications. It can also be deployed in a variety of environments, including on-premises, in the cloud, and in hybrid deployments.

Hasura's GraphQL API makes it easy to consume data from your data products. GraphQL is a powerful query language that allows you to specify exactly the data that you need. This makes it easy to build applications that only use the data that they need, which can improve performance and scalability.

Learn more about it on the [official website](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/index/).

## Usage

To get information on how to use this template, refer to this [document](./docs/index.md).

### Component Testing

To verify the component before deploying it along with the Data Product, the component needs to be tested against a CUE Policy defined for a [Hasura Output Port](./policies/hasura.cue). This policy needs to be defined inside the **Governance** section of the Witboost Platform.

For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.witboost.agilelab.it/docs/p1_user/p5_managing_policies/p5_1_overview).
